# Halloween-Pumpkins
I am developing a simple game to fight against the Halloween Monster Marnus for Halloween Pumpkins .Let's see who wins more Pumpkins after 10 rounds ;)


while(rounds<=10){
  if(your_number>number_by_marnus){
       Your get a Halloween Pumpkin
  
  }

else if(your_number<number_by_marnus){
    Marnus gets a Halloween Pumpkin
}


else if(your_number==number_by_marnus){
    Nobody gets a Pumpkin
}
}



You are fighting for Halloween Pumpkins in a town called 'Lazy Angeles'! ;p
