# RandomNumberGame
I am developing a simple game where I will be having a match again Random function.Let's see who wins after 10 rounds ;)
In this playground its you playing against Monster named Marnus. There will be ten rounds.

while(rounds<=10){
  if(your_number>number_by_marnus){
       Your get a Halloween Pumpkin
  
  }

else if(your_number<number_by_marnus){
    Marnus gets a Halloween Pumpkin
}


else if(your_number==number_by_marnus){
    Nobody gets a Pumpkin
}
}



You are fighting for Halloween Pumpkins in a town called 'Lazy Angeles'! ;p
