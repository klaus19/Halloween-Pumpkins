# RandomNumberGame
I am developing a simple game where I will be having a match again Random function.Let's see who wins after 10 rounds ;)
In this playground its you playing against Monster named Marnus. There will be ten rounds, if number selected by you is greater than number of Marnus, you get a point.  
if(your_number<number_by_marnus){
    Marnus gets point
}else if(your_number==number_by_marnus){
     Nobody gets a point.
}

You are fighting for Halloween Pumpkins in a town called 'Lazy Angeles'! ;p 

Technology used:- Android , Kotlin, maybe Java in future, Lottie Library for animation of Splash Screen.
